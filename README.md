# Flight Crash Investigation
Finding interesting trends/behaviors while analyzing and perform clustering on the dataset. ( ⭐️ Star us on GitHub — it helps! )

 I build this notebook for quick overview on `Airplane crashes since 1908)` dataset.
For your convenience, please view it in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iamrohitsingh/flight-crash-investigation/notebook).

I encourage you to fork this kernel/GitHub repo, play with the code and learn new trends and patterns. The EDA & Visualizations are included to allow developers to dive into analysis of dataset. Good luck!

## Requirements

This project requires  **Python 2.7**  and the following Python libraries installed:

-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-   [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/#)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute an  [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

## Code

An ipython notebook is used for data preprocessing, trend analysis and data visualiation. All core scripts are in `file .ipynb"` folder. All input data are in `input` folder and the detailed description of the data can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908).

### Python / Jupyter

-   `$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk`
-   `$ pip3 install jupyter`
-   Add  `~/.local/bin`  to your path variable (in your  `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`, see  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7360889/adding-a-directory-to-path-in-ubuntu](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7360889/adding-a-directory-to-path-in-ubuntu))

### Usage

In your project directory, start the notebook with:

-   `PYTHON=python3 jupyter notebook`
-   Click on  **New**  and start coding/exploring.
